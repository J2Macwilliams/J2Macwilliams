I'm a Problem Solver, a Developer, and a Teammate. Recently, I completed Lambda school, where the groundwork was set for my technical skills.

Previous to Lambda, I had positions in the Restaurant Industry with creative venture on the side. From these pursuits, I developed skills in customer service, communication, organization, perseverance, efficiency, team building, and delivery. 

I'm excited about future opportunities to develop scalable impactful applications and work on amazing teams.
